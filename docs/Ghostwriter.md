## Prerequisites

- A GhostWriter account

## Step 1: Create a project in GhostWriter

The first step to configuring GhostWriter is to create a new project. You can create multiple projects to manage different documentation needs--for example, you might have one project for third-party developer content and another project with documentation that won't be shared externally.

1. Log in to your GhostWriter account.
1. Navigate to the **Projects** section.
1. Click **Create New Project**.
1. Enter project details.
   1. **Name**: Enter the name of your project. Because you can manage multiple projects from your GhostWriter account, it's important to give each project a descriptive name.
   1. **Description**: Enter additional details about this project as needed. This field supports Markdown, so you can format and structure the description like a ```readme``` file.
1. Click **Save.**

## Step 2: Create or Reference a Style Guide

To ensure your content adheres to your company's style and guidelines, you can either create a new style guide in GhostWriter or reference an existing one by providing a URL or importing a file.

1. Navigate to the **Projects** section, then select a project.
1. Navigate to the **Style Guides** section of the project. 
1. Click **Create New Style Guide.**
1. Enter a **Name** for your style guide.
1. In the text field, explain in natural language what rules or conventions you want GhostWriter to follow when it generates content. You can copy and paste text from another application, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word.
1. You can also import a style guide from a file or URL. 
   1. To upload a file, click **Import**. Supported file types include .DOC, .DOCX, .PDF, .XLS, and .XLSX.
   1. To import from a website or a document available online (like a Google Doc), paste the link in the **URL** field.
6. Click **Save** to add the style guide to GhostWriter.

## Step 3: Create and Edit a Glossary

A glossary helps GhostWriter understand and use your company's specific terminology consistently throughout your documentation. You can input your glossary directly or upload a file.

1. Navigate to the **Glossary** section of your project.
1. Click **Create New Glossary.**
1. Enter a **Name** for your style guide.
1. In the text field, add terms and their definitions. You don't need to format your terms and definitions in any specific way. You can also copy and paste text from another application, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word.
1. You can also import a glossary from a file or URL. 
   1. To upload a file, click **Import**. Supported file types include .DOC, .DOCX, .PDF, .XLS, and .XLSX.
   1. To import from a website or a document available online (like a Google Sheet), paste the link in the **URL** field.
1. Click **Save** to add the glossary to GhostWriter.

To edit your glossary:

1. Go to the **Glossary** section.
2. Find the term you want to edit and click the **Edit** button.
3. Update the term or definition as needed.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

## Step 3: Adjust Content Settings

Customize the tone, formality, and conciseness of your content to align with your company's preferences and the needs of your target audience.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section of your project.
1. Under **Content Settings**, adjust the settings as needed:
   - **Tone:** Choose from options such as friendly, neutral, or professional.
   - **Formality:** Select from informal, semi-formal, or formal.
   - **Conciseness:** Adjust the slider to control the level of detail in your content, from concise to detailed.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

GhostWriter should now be configured to generate documentation that adheres to your custom style guide, uses your specified terminology, and matches your preferred tone, formality, and level of detail. As you create new projects or update existing ones, GhostWriter will automatically apply these settings to ensure consistent, high-quality documentation.
